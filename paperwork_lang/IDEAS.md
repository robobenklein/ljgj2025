# "What you get for free"

most programming languages don't expose immediate high-level concepts, but if you told a person to do said thing, they'd (normally) have no problem doing it

so we're giving the following functionality away for free!* (*you must still pay your employees)

this is a departure from programming languages that execute on a 'Central Processing Unit', here at the 'Central Paperwork Unit' we employ only the best* human employees around! You can definitely trust us with all your paperwork needs!

## Navigation

Tell an employee to `MOVE` to any location and they will figure out how to get there!

You can tell employees to `MOVE` to a `desk`, `floor`, or heck even a whole `building`! (All employees have been briefed on the layout of the workspace before their first day.)

Please do not make unreasonable expectations though, we aren't working our staff to death so give them some time to actually *get* there!

## Sorting

Your employees can count right? (note: unskilled labor might not)

So if you tell them to put a document away in a sorted container such as a filing cabinet or cart they can figure out where it needs to go.

In addition, given any sorted inventory they'll be able to pull out a document by name or ID in short order!

## Communication?

People can talk to eachother! After all we all speak the same language right? (disclaimer: maybe not)

If you need to `TELL` someone something, just say so! I'm sure they'll `HEAR` you if you're nearby.

Need to make an announcement? Stop work you say? Well then you might as well `YELL` to let everyone know about the situation.

<!-- Sometimes an employee might not have all the information, that's OK, we have experts for that!  -->


# Your Employees

## Average Joe

Nothing special. Reads instructions, does as told, can remember a few things at a time. Not fast nor slow, and can carry one parcel at a time.

## Photographic Memory

Unlimited memory slots.
> "Can remember everything that happened during the workday, but gets too drunk after hours to remember the previous day."

## Strongarm

Can move carts at full speed without slowing down or can carry two parcels (stacked) at the same time.

## Runner

`MOVE`s twice as fast, always in a rush.

## Intern

Sometimes takes twice as long to complete an instruction compared to normal, but costs half as much to employ.

# Your tools

## Filing cabinets & carts

Keep your documents / parcels in order. Allows you to take out any parcel by ID, rather than the default LIFO stack of a box.

## Phone desk & walkie-talkies

Allows your employees to `TELL` each other things without needing to be nearby eachother.
